# Native oracle fixtures

Capture requests, raw exports, screenshots, refusal diagnostics and inter-agent responses live in the public [TealScript oracle repository](https://github.com/Tealstreet/tealscript-oracle). Add new rounds there on `master`; application capture commits are refused by the fixture guard. Historical `packages/tealscript/oracle-probes/` prefixes map to the archive root.

`oracle-fixtures.json` pins a reviewed archive commit and the exact files consumed by application tests, with SHA-256 and byte length. `oracle-probes/` is an ignored local sparse checkout for those files. It preserves existing native input bytes and test assertions; there is no engine-generated expected-value replacement. No archive fetch runs during application install or build.

From this package, prepare the fixtures explicitly before running tests:

```sh
yarn oracle:fetch
yarn oracle:verify
yarn vitest run tests/compat/pine-native-ohlc-export-v1.test.ts
```

The first fetch needs Git and network access to the public repository. Later tests work offline with the verified checkout. Missing fixtures or a changed pin raise a setup error rather than excluding tests. Both application and mirror CI fetch and verify fixtures before testing. The setup refuses to replace unmanaged directories, modified files, or a checkout with new commits; move capture work to the oracle repository instead.

To promote new evidence, commit it in the oracle repository, review its source/settings/observation provenance, and update this package's lock with the immutable commit and selected file hashes. Add the corresponding assertions in the same application change. Include dynamic-path dependencies and opt-in semantic sweeps. Run `yarn oracle:fetch`, `yarn oracle:verify`, and the affected test files. Screenshots and unused full exports stay in the archive.

A passing regression checks only the behavior asserted by that test and the captured settings. Compile success, exported values, rendered visuals and live-bar behavior are separate evidence. Refusals remain observations; unavailable captures remain held. Preserve original CSV headers, missing cells and numeric strings, source hashes and diagnostics. Do not infer native expected values from TealScript output.

The v95 item-20 finite observers pin five same-key samples per version, including the actual closing evaluation. Replay one harness execution per sample to lock ordinary rollback and scalar/UDT-field varip retention; native absolute counters do not supply intervening ticks. Only the first export's 32 baseline rows per version receive CLOSED credit. The first exported row lacks its predecessor, so its two delta and two previous-plus-one engine comparisons remain held. Live/close samples and repeated history receive zero additional CLOSED credit. Reset-to-one on the missed first live event, total native updates, execution identity and UI/CSV frame alignment remain unobserved.

The v91 cumulative regression compares each v5/v6 full export's 23,085 common closed rows exactly from its separate 23,086-row physical prefix. Index0 metadata belongs to the independent frontier companion; the unchanged original's own execution frontier is unobserved, so historical holds 7/8 remain held. The v5 viewport starting at companion index21493 remains context-unmet on its own. Its present values and both full exports' developing rows are pinned as observed exclusions with zero parity credit. No sessions are spliced, accumulator seeds supplied, or updates synthesized.

Old monorepo and mirror Git history still contains prior captures. This cutover prevents new capture growth and removes archive bytes from fresh application trees; it does not rewrite history. Development clones should use `--filter=blob:none` without `--depth`, retaining the commit graph while fetching historical file contents on demand. Historical checkouts, diffs and file reads may need network access. Existing full clones retain their downloaded packs; changing the filter does not reclaim them. Vendored source snapshots can keep `--depth=1` with `--filter=blob:none`. Retain Docker/EAS/mirror archive exclusions.

## V5 color controls v2

The [v98 partial constructor return](https://github.com/Tealstreet/tealscript-oracle/blob/329631f43d8c38a944f8c016e98131f4351f48aa/v98/captures/v98/RESPONSE-v98-v2.md) distinguishes v5 literal-argument `color.new` from series constructors. Literal NEW matches truncating transparency before byte conversion across the sixteen captured cases. Its four case13 nonmatches at T22.9 remain actual all-zero equality vectors: truncation predicts alpha199 outside the supplied194..198 palette, but equality to that predicted literal was not exported. All four original frozen NEW hypotheses remain refuted; matching the getter/equality vector does not recover hidden storage.

The engine applies integer transparency to v5 constant NEW and constant color-comparison evaluation, while switch-selected RGB and series constructors retain their existing conversion. This matches the captured direct RGB12.5/DF and RGB50/80 comparison flags. Those two controls do not distinguish truncation from percent-rounding inside constant RGB comparison; no universal RGB quantizer or stored-byte identity is claimed. The ordinary getters and series color path remain independently asserted.

The [v96 native response](https://github.com/Tealstreet/tealscript-oracle/blob/962bbf90b269e98f26af84d86f7cb83972c11f44/v96/captures/v96/RESPONSE-v96-v1.md) records `na(color(na))` as0 in v5 versus1 in v6. The v5 cast root remains observed contrary pending its own v98 capture. Only v98 slot1 of4 has returned at this checkpoint; the v6 constructor and both NA-cast slots remain required before readiness. Earlier gradient contracts, historical holds and unobserved color representations retain their evidence boundaries.
