# Drawing Tools Plan

This tracks user markup work for Tealchart. Web Canvas and mobile Skia must land
matching behavior in the same PR for every user-facing drawing feature.

## Shipped

- Shared drawing geometry, render model, hit testing, input draft state, and
  canvas renderer.
- Widget and Skia chart user drawing state APIs.
- Web and mobile drawing input for placing supported drawing types.
- Web Canvas and mobile Skia passive rendering for committed, draft, and
  selected drawing states.

## Current Epic: Selection Foundation

- Shared selection helper resolves a screen point to the topmost visible,
  unlocked drawing and clears selection on misses.
- Web click/tap and mobile tap behavior use the same helper in select mode while
  preserving drawing placement priority for active drawing tools.

## Known Gaps

- Drag editing for handles and whole drawings.
- Keyboard or command API deletion for selected drawings.
- Toolbar-facing APIs for tool selection and selected drawing actions.
- Text editing UX for text labels.
- Persistence handoff into app-level chart layout state.
